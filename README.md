# LMTech Capstone Project:House Price Prediction
Overview
This project is a house price prediction model developed as part of the LMTech Capstone Project. The goal is to accurately predict house prices based on various features, including location, size, number of rooms, and other attributes. Using machine learning algorithms, I aim to build a model that provides reliable price predictions, aiding potential buyers, real estate agents, and analysts.

### Project Objectives
Data Analysis and Cleaning: Understand and preprocess the data for optimal model performance.
Feature Engineering: Identify key features that influence house prices and refine them to improve model accuracy.
Model Training: Experiment with different machine learning models to find the best one for predicting house prices.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance.
Deployment: Make the model available for use in real-time predictions.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various attributes that can influence house prices, including but not limited to:

- Location: Geographical location or neighborhood.
- Square Footage: Total area of the house.
- Number of Bedrooms and Bathrooms.
- Age of the Property.etc.

#### Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run the project, you will need:

- Python 3.8+
- Git LFS (for handling large model files if required)
- Required libraries listed in requirements.txt
